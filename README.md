# Fake News Classifier

## Project Overview
The **Fake News Classifier** project aims to build a robust and scalable deep learning model to classify news articles as either genuine or fake. With the proliferation of fake news on digital platforms, this project addresses a critical societal challenge by providing a tool to automatically flag misleading content. The classifier is developed using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and neural network-based deep learning models.

## Skills and Concepts
Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Data Augmentation**
- **Text Pre-processing**
- **Feature Extraction**
- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Model Selection**
- **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Hyper-parameter Tuning**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

## Domain
**Media and Entertainment**

## Problem Statement
Develop a neural network-based deep learning model to classify fake news. The model will help mitigate the risks associated with the spread of misinformation by automatically identifying and flagging potentially misleading news articles.

## Business Use Case
The system can be integrated into news platforms to automatically flag and filter out fake news, thereby reducing the impact of misinformation on public opinion and society.

## Approach and Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Download and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze data distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Development:**
   - Develop baseline models.
   - Implement deep learning models, including RNNs and Transformer-based models.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Train the models and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics.
6. **Model Selection:**
   - Compare different models and select the best-performing one.
7. **Hyper-parameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the model to achieve the best performance.

## Results
The project aims to develop a high-performing fake news classifier capable of:
- Achieving a high F1-score to balance precision and recall.
- Handling diverse and large-scale datasets efficiently.
- Providing reliable predictions that can be integrated into news platforms to flag potentially fake news articles.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **WELFake** dataset, which contains 72,134 news articles, with 35,028 labeled as real and 37,106 as fake. The dataset is a combination of several well-known news datasets, providing a diverse set of examples for better machine learning training.

- **Columns:**
  - `Serial Number`: Index starting from 0.
  - `Title`: Headline of the news article.
  - `Text`: Full content of the news article.
  - `Label`: 0 for fake news, 1 for real news.
