trump presidency is bedeviled is undeniableas president donald trump flew off for august at his jersey club there came word that special counsel robert mueller iii had impaneled a grand jury and subpoenas were going out to trump family and campaign associatesthe jurors will be drawn from a pool of citizens in a city hillary clinton swept with 91 percent of the vote trump got 4 percentwhatever indictments mueller wants mueller getsthanks to a media that savages him ceaselessly trump is down to 33 percent approval in a quinnipiac university poll and below 40 percent in most of the restbefore trump departed dc the washington post ran transcripts of his phone conversations with the leaders of mexico and australiaeven obama administration veterans were stunnedso it is time to ask if this city brings trump down will the rest of america rejoicewhat will be the reaction out there in flyover country that land where the  deplorables  dwell who produce the soldiers to fight our wars will they toast the  free press  that brought down the president they elected and in whom they had placed so much hopemy guess the reaction will be one of bitterness cynicism despair a sense that the fix is in that no matter what we do they will not let us win if trump is brought down american democracy will take a pasting it will be seen as a fraud and the backlash will poison our politics to where only an attack from abroad like 911 will reunite usour media preen and posture as the defenders of democracy devoted to truth who provide us roundtheclock protection from tyranny but half the nation already sees the media as a propaganda arm of a liberal establishment that the people have rejected time and againconsider the post s publication of the transcripts of trump s calls with mexico s president and australia s prime ministerwhen reporter greg miller got these transcripts his editors knowing they would damage trump plastered them on page 1the post was letting itself be used by a leaker engaged in disloyal and possibly criminal misconduct yet the post agreed to provide confidentiality and to hide the trumphater s identitythis is what we do says the post people have a right to know if president trump says one thing at rallies about mexico paying for the wall and another to the president of mexico this is a storybut there is a far larger story here of which this post piece is but an exhibit it is the story of a concerted campaign in which the antitrump media publish leaks even criminal leaks out of the fbi cia nsa and nsc to bring down a president whom the beltway media and their deepstate collaborators both despise and wish to destroydid trump collude with putin to defeat clinton the beltway media demand to know even as they daily collude with deepstate criminals to bring down the president of the united statesand if there is an unfolding silent coup by the regime americans repudiated in 2016   to use security leaks and the lethal weapon of a special counsel to overturn the election results   is that not a story worth covering as much as what trump said to pena nietodo the people not have a right know who are the snakes collaborating with the nevertrump press to bring down their head of state is not discovering the identities of deepstate felons a story that investigative reporters should be all overif greg miller is obligated to protect his source fine but why are other journalists not exposing his identitythe answer suggests itself this is a collaborative enterprise where everyone protects everyone else s sources because all have the same goal the dumping of trump if that requires collusion with criminals so be itthe justice department is now running down the leaks and the aclu s ben wizner is apoplectic  every american should be concerned about the trump administration s threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists a crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy that s one way to put it another is that some of these  whistleblowers  are political criminals who reject the verdict of the american electorate in 2016 and are out to overturn it and the aforementioned  journalists  are their enablers and collaboratorsand if as wizner s asserts protecting secrets is tantamount to a  crackdown on the free press and democracy  no wonder the free press and democracy are falling into disrepute all over the worldby colluding the mainstream media deep state and the special prosecutor s button men with a license to roam may bring down yet another president so doing they will validate
