3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Development:**
   - Develop baseline models.
   - Implement deep learning models, including RNNs and Transformer-based models.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Train the models and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics.
6. **Model Selection:**
   - Compare different models and select the best-performing one.
7. **Hyper-parameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the model to achieve the best performance.

## Results
The project aims to develop a high-performing fake news classifier capable of:
- Achieving a high F1-score to balance precision and recall.
- Handling diverse and large-scale datasets efficiently.
- Providing reliable predictions that can be integrated into news platforms to flag potentially fake news articles.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **WELFake** dataset, which contains 72,134 news articles, with 35,028 labeled as real and 37,106 as fake. The dataset is a combination of several well-known news datasets, providing a diverse set of examples for better machine learning training.

- **Columns:**
  - `Serial Number`: Index starting from 0.
  - `Title`: Headline of the news article.
  - `Text`: Full content of the news article.
  - `Label`: 0 for fake news, 1 for real news.
