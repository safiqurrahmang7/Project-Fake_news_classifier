## Folder Information

This folder is used to store dataset files. Large files such as `.csv` datasets are intentionally ignored in version control to avoid exceeding repository size limits and ensure faster cloning of the repository.

### Note:
- If you need the dataset files, you can download them from the source provided in the [project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFIgNCLuhrnj1GUHzzXewjVSS533zauI/edit).
- Ensure that you place the dataset files in this folder after downloading.
